- Do not execute bash or Python scripts outside Colab.
- Sole target: generate monthly revenue on stocks.
- Use state-of-the-art methods with direct revenue impact.
- Always include tests and follow best practices.
- Before adding packages, ensure theyâ€™re in `colab_setup/colab_requirements.txt` or justify additions.
- No mock/placeholder code.
