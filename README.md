# AI/SEMICONDUCTOR TRADING STRATEGY

**Target**: Maximizing long-term monthly revenue generation through AI/semiconductor stock trading
**Goal**: 8-15% monthly returns on $1-2k test capital

### Portfolio Specification
- **Stocks**: NVDA, AMD, ASML, TSM, INTC, QCOM, AVGO, MU, SMCI, ARM (10 stocks)
- **Capital**: $1-2k test capital, scaling potential
- **Position Types**: Long/short capabilities, no leverage
- **Position Sizing**: 0.25x Kelly criterion, max 20% per stock ($200-400)
- **Active Trades**: 3-5 positions maximum

### Model Stack (SOTA 2024-2025)
- **Primary**: TimesFM (Google 500M parameter time series foundation model)
- **Secondary**: TSMamba/MambaStock (state space models for stock patterns)
- **Tertiary**: SAMBA (Graph-Mamba for inter-stock correlations)
- **Meta-Learning**: Adaptive ensemble weighting based on recent performance
- **Uncertainty**: MAPIE conformal prediction for confidence intervals

### Revenue Targets & Risk Management
- **Monthly Returns**: 8-15% (conservative to aggressive phases)
- **Volatility**: 15-20% annualized
- **Maximum Drawdown**: 10-15%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Target >2.0
- **Win Rate**: Target 65-75%

### Multi-Timeframe Strategy
- **Intraday (5-min)**: Scalping 0.5-1% per trade (70% confidence, <3% interval)
- **Daily**: Swing trades 2-5% targets (75% confidence)
- **Weekly**: Position trades 5-10% targets (75% confidence)
- **Execution Rule**: Expected return >2x transaction costs

### Regime-Adaptive Allocation
- **Bull Market**: 75% allocation (momentum following)
- **Bear Market**: 40% allocation (short bias with hedging)
- **Volatile Market**: 25% allocation (reduced exposure)
- **Range Market**: 65% allocation (mean reversion)

### Implementation Phases
- **Phase 1**: TimesFM + MAPIE foundation (5-7% monthly)
- **Phase 2**: TSMamba + regime detection (7-9% monthly)
- **Phase 2.1**: Multi-timeframe integration (8-10% monthly)
- **Phase 2.2**: SAMBA correlations (9-12% monthly)
- **Phase 2.3**: Advanced models + long/short (10-15% monthly)

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed implementation plan.

---

Foundation: TimesFM (primary), TSMamba/MambaStock (patterns), SAMBA (correlations); dynamic meta-weighting.
Uncertainty: MAPIE conformal intervals; >75% confidence, non-zero 95% interval, >2x costs.
Sentiment: Rule-based + selective Claude ($50/month cap).
Revenue Features: Multi-timeframe (intraday/daily/weekly); adaptive Kelly sizing (0.25x with confidence/drawdown); HMM-RL regime detection (regime-specific allocations); Portfolio (60% core, 30% satellite, 10% cash).

2:
Core Architecture (Best of Both Worlds)

Foundation Layer - Ensemble Approach

Primary: TimesFM (500M parameter version) for robust baseline
Secondary: TSMamba/MambaStock for stock-specific patterns
Tertiary: Graph-Mamba (SAMBA) for inter-stock correlations
Weighting: Dynamic based on recent performance (adaptive meta-learning)


Uncertainty Quantification (Critical for Revenue)

Primary: Conformal Prediction with MAPIE for prediction intervals
Enhancement: Ensemble uncertainty from model disagreement
Trading Rule: Only execute trades when:

Confidence > 75% (stricter than Strategy 2's 70%)
Prediction interval excludes zero with 95% confidence
Expected return > 2x transaction costs

Sentiment Analysis (Cost-Effective Hybrid)

Rule-based baseline (Strategy 1) for cost efficiency
LLM augmentation (Strategy 2) only for high-conviction setups
Budget: Allocate $50/month for Claude API calls on top opportunities



Revenue Optimization Features (New Additions)

Multi-Timeframe Fusion

Intraday: 5-minute predictions for scalping (high frequency, small gains)
Daily: End-of-day predictions for swing trades
Weekly: Trend following for position trades
Revenue Impact: Diversifies income streams across timeframes


Adaptive Position Sizing
pythonposition_size = kelly_fraction * confidence_score * (1 - drawdown_penalty)

Kelly Criterion with safety factor (0.25x Kelly)
Scale with prediction confidence
Reduce during drawdowns


Market Regime Detection

Hidden Markov Model for regime classification
Different strategies per regime:

Bull: Momentum following (70% capital allocation)
Bear: Short bias with hedging (50% allocation)
Volatile: Options strategies (30% allocation)
Range: Mean reversion (60% allocation)




Portfolio Construction

Core Holdings (60%): High-confidence, low-volatility positions
Satellite (30%): Higher risk/reward opportunities
Cash Reserve (10%): For extreme opportunities



Implementation Priorities for Revenue Generation
Month 1: Foundation

Deploy TimesFM baseline (immediate predictions)
Set up paper trading infrastructure
Implement basic conformal prediction
Target: Positive paper returns

Month 2: Enhancement

Add MambaStock for stock-specific patterns
Implement ensemble weighting
Add basic sentiment analysis
Target: 55% win rate

Month 3: Optimization

Graph-Mamba for correlations
Advanced position sizing
Regime detection
Target: Sharpe > 1.5

Months 4-6: Scaling

Expand to 30-50 stocks
Add options strategies
Implement online learning
Target: Consistent 5-10% monthly returns

Why This Hybrid Beats Both Original Strategies

vs Strategy 1:

More aggressive position sizing (higher returns)
Selective LLM use (better signal quality)
Multi-timeframe approach (more opportunities)


vs Strategy 2:

Lower costs (rule-based baseline)
Better risk management (stricter confidence thresholds)
More detailed implementation roadmap


Unique Advantages:

Adaptive to market conditions
Multiple revenue streams
Better uncertainty quantification
Proven architecture components



Critical Success Factors

Data Quality: Use multiple sources for validation
Execution Speed: Sub-second for intraday trades
Risk Discipline: Never override stop losses
Continuous Learning: Weekly model updates
Diversification: Minimum 10 uncorrelated positions

This hybrid approach provides the best path to consistent monthly revenue by combining proven technologies with practical risk management and multiple income strategies.
