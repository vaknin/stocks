"""Multi-Resolution Ensemble System for Pattern Recognition Enhancement.

This module implements Phase 5 of the ensemble enhancement roadmap:
- Minute-scale predictor for high-frequency pattern recognition
- Hourly predictor for medium-term temporal patterns  
- Weekly predictor for long-term trends and seasonal patterns
- Resolution fusion network for multi-scale prediction integration
- Adaptive resolution weighting based on market conditions

Expected improvement: 8-15% pattern recognition enhancement through multi-scale analysis.
Research foundation: AFRN-HyperFlow adaptive ensemble framework (2024).
